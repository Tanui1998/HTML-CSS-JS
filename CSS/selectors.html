        <strong class="uppercase">There have been researches made about topics related to modelling the Kenyan shilling</strong>
        to other foreign currencies. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/timeseries.asp">Some tried to show the causes of the fluctuations of Kenyan
            currency to other foreign currencies</a>.
        <i>Cenk U fok Yilden and Abdurhama Fettahglu (2017)</i> conducted Us Dollar vs Turkish Lira
        (USD/TRY )rate forecast by <a href="https://www.whizlabs.com/"> ARIMA Method using 3,069 daily observations</a>. between the
        dates 3 January 2005 and 8 March 2017 .<div>The results show that the short term ARIMAs
            outperform the long term ARIMAs in predicting the accuracy specifically for the short
            term ARIMAs appropriate specification raised as ARIMA(2 1 0) on the other hand for
            the long term ARIMAs ,The best order emerged as ARIMA (0 1 1)</div>
        Oyenuya I.F ,Oyekule J.O, Albona A.A (2019) modeled exchange rate of Naira against
        four major currencies that is; Euro, Pounds, Dollar and Swiss frank using ARIMA
        model.The data was extracted from Central Bank of Nigeria ,Statistical Bulletin between
        1999 to 2017.The results shows that Dollar,Pounds,Euro and Swiss franz time series data
        were satisfactory stationary after the second difference followed ARIMA (1 2 1),(2 2 1)
        and (2 2 2) respectively with corresponding AIC of 51.122,55.370,71.027 and 73.819
        Tran Mong Vyen Ngan(2019) forecasted exchange rate between Vietnam dong vs US

        This study uses secondary-sourced monthly data from the Central Bank of Kenya Website 
        spanning seventeen years, from 2005 to 2020. This chapter will cover the methods to use in our 
        regression analysis. This chapter also covers the definition of variables and their measurements.
        3.2 Theoretical Framework
        Regression Analysis
        Multiple Linear Regression
        It is a statistical technique for predicting a variable's outcome based on the values of two or more 
        variables. It is an extension of linear regression and is also referred to simply as multiple 
        regression. The dependent variable is the one we aim to predict, whereas the independent or 
        explanatory variables are the ones we use to forecast the value of the dependent variable. The 
        Ordinary Least Squares fitting method will be used in this project. (Lynn E,2012)
