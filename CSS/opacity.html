        A time series is a sequence of data points that occur 
        in successive order over some period of time. 
        This can be contrasted with cross-sectional data, which captures a point-in-time.
        In investing, a time series tracks the movement of the chosen data points, 
        such as a security’s price, over a specified period of time with data points 
        recorded at regular intervals. 
        There is no minimum or maximum amount of time that must be included, 
        allowing the data to be gathered in a way that provides the information 
        being sought by the investor or analyst examining the activity.
